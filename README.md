# Computer-Graphics
This is a master's course project, in which we use MFC programming and OpneGL architecture in C++ to implement color transfer, image distortion, mesh simplification, etc.

## Introduction
The repository includes the main code architecture of each project of the computer graphics course, which realizes the functions of color transfer, image warping, rasterization and surface simplification, etc. At the same time, in order to improve the readability of the project and the visualization of the program results, we also attach the corresponding experiment reports and development documents.

## Usage
Projects that contain main.cpp can run programs by directly executing main.cpp, while other programs may include only the main framework of the MFC, which needs to be reorganized.
